To run this code, upload G-Mixup.ipynb file on your Google Colab account. 
For speeding up the process, choose `T4 GPU` as your runtime type. 
To change your runtime type, you need to choose `Change runtime type` from `Runtime` menu.

In the first cell you can define the hyper parameters, such as number of hidden layers and number of epochs. 
There are five different acceptable datasets, including `IMDB-BINARY`, `IMDB-MULTI`, `REDDIT-BINARY`, `REDDIT-MULTI-5K`, and `REDDIT-MULTI-12K`. 
If you are using the free version of Google Colab, the provided RAM cannot run this code for `REDDIT-MULTI-5K` and `REDDIT-MULTI-12K`. 

After defining everything, you just need to choose `Run all` from `Runtime` menu. 
You can see the results from the two last cells of code.
